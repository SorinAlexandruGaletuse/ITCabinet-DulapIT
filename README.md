Having my SBC stacker all over the place i have found a 10 inch mini rack that i think will be suitable for a project in order to stack them all and create a small and compact server.

As i don't have time, this will be a continuous project and can be customised for everyone need.

There will be a list of components that was usefull for the build of this rack and also the hardware components.

Some parts are 3d printed using the STL's that i found from open source and some modified by me to fit other boards.

To find it much easier to follow, there will be created a few folder where information will be stack there.
